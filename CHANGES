Revision history for Perl module Git::PurePerl:

0.42
     - allow put_object to update other heads than just 'master'
       (thanks to martijn)

0.41 Tue Apr 21 20:41:07 BST 2009
     - allow subdirectories in .git/refs/*/ (thanks to martijn)
     - run protocol.t test with --base-path to not care about where
       on the filesystem the checkout is (thanks to martijn)
     - when parsing a commit, split up the author and committer
       fields into name, email and commit time. This adds two new
       DateTime fields, authored_time and committed_time to ::Commit
       and changes the type of the author and committer fields to
       Git::PurePerl::Actor, which is an object with name and
       email fields (thanks to martijn)
     - add the parent field to a new commit when available (thanks
       to martijn)
     - allow bare repositories with the gitdir parameter (thanks
       to martijn)
     - fill new commits with real author, authored_time, committer,
       committed_time and comment (thanks to martijn)
